# Bio_Page

## This is a simple html tribute page about Elon Musk.

## This was a initial submission for the freeCodecamp.org responsive web design project.

## As a growing developer I am always open to advice on improvement.

## Things that I learned from making constructing this page. 
- Learning what a user story item in software development. 
- Applying responsive web design concepts.
- Create a tribute biography page for a person that inspires me.
